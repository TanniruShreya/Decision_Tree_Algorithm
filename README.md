# Decision_Tree_Algorithm

##Project Title Name:

Predicition of iris.csv dataset for decision tree algorithm using supervised learning machine algorithm 

#Problem Statement:

#A American based botnical garden a grow iris flower in their labs but using bio technology in a single tree different type of varitey flower is grow.
#As a DataScience Engineer find out how much accuracy is their all categorys contains same spieces

#Project Apporach
